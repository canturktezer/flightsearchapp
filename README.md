# Flight Search Application

This is a Flight Search Application that allows users to search for flights between different cities. Users can search for one-way or round-trip flights and sort the results based on various filters.

## To start the development server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the command: "npm start"

This will start the server and allow you to access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## About Mock Data:
In the project directory, you'll find the mockData.json file.

Open the `mockData.json` file using Visual Studio Code.

Inside the file, you will find the copy of the mock data that I created on the mockapi.io platform.

## Using Filter:

To effectively test the filters, you can select Atlanta, ATL for the "From" input and Chicago, ORD for the "To" input.
Two flights available on this route, you will be able to observe the filtering feature more comprehensively.
